Global Demographics and Economic Analysis
Project Overview
This project provides a data-driven look at the current state of the world. By analyzing a comprehensive dataset of global statistics, I explored the relationships between economic power (GDP), population density, and social factors like birth rates and life expectancy.

Objective
The primary goal was to perform deep Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA) to find correlations between a country's economic standing and its demographic trends.

Data Science Techniques Used
Data Cleaning: Managing missing values in global indicators and correcting data types for large numerical values.

Statistical Analysis: Calculating Skewness and Kurtosis to understand the distribution of global wealth and population.

Correlation Mapping: Using Heatmaps to identify how strongly land area or urbanization correlates with economic output.

Visual Discovery: Creating distribution plots and scatter plots to visualize the divide between developing and developed nations.

Key Insights
Wealth Distribution: The analysis shows a high level of skewness in global GDP, highlighting the concentration of wealth in a small number of nations.

Birth Rate Trends: There is a significant inverse correlation between a country's urbanization/wealth and its birth rate.

Outlier Detection: Identified "outlier" countries that have disproportionately high population densities compared to their total land area.

Tech Stack
Python: Main programming language.

Pandas & NumPy: For data wrangling and statistical calculations.

Seaborn & Matplotlib: For creating professional, academic-style visualizations.

SciPy: For advanced statistical testing (skew/kurtosis).
